Hello World project repository created for the GitHub Tutorial.

Although I know a bit about HTML and CSS, I'm a beginner coder. I'm learning Git, GitHub, Ruby, and a few other programs through Flatiron School. I hope to be a knowledable and highly-skilled developer by the end of my Flatiron education.
